# Introduction
This is a Java 21 web application using Spring MVC, with JUnit for unit testing and Playwright for e2e testing. For this application, I firstly used [Spring Initializr](https://start.spring.io/) with the Maven package manager and the Spring Web and Thymeleaf dependencies. Spring Web is useful for building web applications using Spring MVC. Thymeleaf serves as a server-side Java template engine for web and standalone environments.

## Development Environment
For this project, I will be using JetBrains IntelliJ for Java development which I have built most of my Java programs and applications with. For source control, I am using GitHub desktop which is my prefered way of simplifying my workflow of using GitHub without using the command line.
