# Introduction
This is a Java 21 web application using Spring MVC, with JUnit for unit testing and Playwright for e2e testing. 
<br/>
This project uses [Spring Initializr](https://start.spring.io/) with the Maven package manager and the Spring Web and Thymeleaf dependencies. Spring Web is useful for building web applications using Spring MVC and Apache Tomcat. Apache Tomcat is a popular option among Java developers, and serves as our Java application server in this project. Thymeleaf is also helpful, as it is a server-side Java template engine for web and standalone environments.

## Development Environment
For this project, the development environment of choice was JetBrains IntelliJ for Java development. For source control, this project uses GitHub Desktop which is my preferred way of simplifying my workflow of using GitHub without using the command line.
